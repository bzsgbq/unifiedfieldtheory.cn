description: Details of the website.
---

This website is mainly used to collect Xiangqian Zhang's Unified Field Theory and many other works. Everyone can watch it for free without any charge. I'll add to it by creating some dynamic demo animations.

All the parts I add will have `Descriptions` / `Markers` like the ones below. Other than that, the rest of the content is from Zhang's book.

:::note
The `Descriptions` / `Markers` indicates that this part was added by **[uft@obiscr.com](mailto:uft@obiscr.com)** and is not from Zhang.

It's worth noting that the section I've added may have been produced incorrectly due to a lack of understanding. If you find an error is found, please [report here](https://github.com/unified-field-theory-org/documentation/issues/new?title=Finding%20animation%20rendering%20errors&labels=animations), thank youÔºÅ


## When to Update

Usually updated every 2-3 days. Made in my spare time, I can't guarantee a steady update frequency.
