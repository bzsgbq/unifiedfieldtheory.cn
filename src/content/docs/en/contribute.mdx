We welcome contributions of any size and any skill level. As an open source project, we believe in giving back to our contributors. We're happy to provide guidance to help you with PR, technical writing, and bringing any ideas to life.

## Ways to Contribute

### Project repositories

Here are many ways to contribute to the **Unified Field Theory Documentation** project!

Visit [Unified Field Theory's GitHub Profile](https://github.com/unified-field-theory-cn) to find the repositories for:

-  [main repo](https://github.com/unified-field-theory-org/unifiedfieldtheory.cn), source code of [unifiedfieldtheory.cn](https://unifiedfieldtheory.cn). 
-  [documentation](https://github.com/unified-field-theory-org/documentation), a repository of Unified Field Theory resources! Contribute not only written content, but also Astro code covering accessibility, CSS, UI, and UX. We also translate the documentation into multiple languages, so we need your help to translate the entire site into other languages.
-  [animations](https://github.com/unified-field-theory-org/animations), a demo animation of the Unified Field Theory, created using [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).

### Types of contributions

In addition to contributing your own code or content, you can also make a huge contribution by getting involved by leaving review comments on PRs, adding ideas in existing GitHub Issues and Discussions, and participating in our "Pinned" issue maintenance tasks!

We also have very active [Forum](https://forum.unifiedfieldtheory.cn) / [Slack](https://unifiedfieldtheorycn.slack.com) / [Discord](https://discord.gg/W3JYMwBBWb) community! We value the community members who help keep our neighborhood healthy.
