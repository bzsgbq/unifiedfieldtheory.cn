Before we get started, you can check out the animated demo here to get the most intuitive understanding of Zhang's Unified Field Theory.

## What is Field

**Zhang's unified field theory states that the essence of a field is a cylindrical spiral moving in space**.

## Electric Field

When space is moving, it generates an electric field in the forward direction. When space stops moving, the electric field disappears.

## Magnetic Field

When space is in moving, it generates a magnetic field in the direction of the tangent to the rotation, when space stops rotating motion, the magnetic field disappears.

## Gravitational Field

When space is in moving, there is an acceleration towards the centre, this is the gravitational field, when space stops rotating motion, the gravitational field disappears.
