We know that electrical energy can make objects move, heat them, cool them, produce sound, produce light, generate electromagnetic fields, process information and so on.

In addition to all the functions of electrical energy, artificial field scanning can also affect space-time, that is, by shining light into space, it can affect the length of space within a local area and the length of time for things to happen in space.

It is also possible to affect the objects present in space by affecting time and space, causing the objects to move.

The positive gravitational field emitted by an artificial field scanning device can increase the mass of an object by irradiating it, while the anti-gravitational field generated by irradiating it can decrease the mass of an object, all the way down to zero.

Once an object is in an excited state of zero mass, it suddenly moves at the speed of light.

Once an object is in a quasi-excited state of near-zero mass, it does not move at the speed of light, but it can pass through a wall, and both the object and the wall are intact.

These unique characteristics of artificial field scanning can not only replace electricity, which is an upgraded product of electricity, but also have the following uses.


## I. Build a vehicle that can travel at the speed of light.

Artificial field scanning irradiates the vehicle, which can make the mass of the vehicle become zero, and as soon as the mass of the vehicle becomes zero, it will suddenly move at the speed of light. This is also the principle of flying saucers.

## II. Cold welding in construction and industrial manufacturing

Artificial field scanning on the object irradiation, can make the object in the quasi-excited state, in the quasi-excited state of the two objects, can be mutual no resistance to cut into each other, withdraw the artificial field, the object is welded together, this is called cold welding.

Artificial field scanning can make cold welding super large-scale use, so that building houses, engineering, industrial manufacturing speed 100 times higher, 100 times lower costs, can be in human production, life, medical - all aspects of the creation of myths.


## III. Artificial information field scanning

Artificial fields work under the control of complex electronic computer programmes called artificial information fields.

Artificial information field can be detected on the human body, cold welding, excitation, heating, can be high-speed cutting, handling and other functions, can be precise positioning of molecules and atoms, identification, batch operation.

Artificial information field can also be operated inside the human body without affecting the outside, the operation does not open the intestine, you can instantly remove objects inside the human body.

Can quickly and completely remove cancer cells, viruses and other harmful substances in the human body, simple and rough, without the need to find the pathogenesis.

Artificial information field of these incredible capabilities, as well as the perfect combination of electronic computers, can enable mankind to completely treat a variety of infectious diseases, cancer, hypertension, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease - a variety of acute and chronic diseases, can make mankind into the drug-free era.

Artificial information field weight loss, cosmetic surgery, sculpture of the human body shape of the effect of magical to incredible, and people without pain.

## IV. Instant Disappearance Movement - Global Movement Network

Using artificial field scanning, a global movement network can be built. The global movement network is built and placed in space. When people travel, all they have to do is to bring a mobile phone and send their movement request to the global movement network, which shines a light on the person using artificial field scanning, and the person immediately disappears and appears in the place they want to be.

The global movement network can make people and commodities appear anywhere in the world within one second, including in a sealed room to do the same. However, the scope of action of the global movement network can only be on one planet, to other planets, only by light-speed vehicles, or called flying saucers.


## V. Global large-scale conductivity without wires

If we don't make a strict distinction between electrical energy and field energy, calling it field energy or electrical energy is just what we call it as human beings, we can think of the global

The global non-conducting conducting centre is understood as the global central energy field, which is the remote, non-contact supply of energy from several satellites in space to all energy users around the globe.


## VI. Converging solar receivers


Artificial field scanning equipment on the space irradiation, through the influence, compression of space, and then can be the space of the sun's photons absorbed down, can be in a square metre on the acceptance of tens of thousands of square metres of solar energy, to solve the energy crisis of mankind, and cheap energy, almost free of charge.

Convergence solar receiver can also artificially reduce the solar energy of a certain place, combined with electronic computer analysis, to strongly control and regulate the weather, to avoid the emergence of harmful weather, because the source of harmful weather is solar energy.


## VII. Infinite compressed space storage, transmission information technology

Any one space in the universe can store the information of the entire universe, and the space can also be infinitely compressed.

The use of artificial field scanning to process information, since the nature of the field is the cylindrical spiral movement of space, is equivalent to the use of space to store and transmit information, and artificial field scanning can upgrade human information technology.

## VIII. Virtual building and light virtual human body

Using the artificial field to exert influence on space, for example, influencing a plane so that this plane generates a field force, and this plane can generate a blocking force on objects moving through it.

Then use the artificial field to lock the light, make this plane colour, so that a virtual plane can be produced, this virtual plane can be used as a concrete wall, using this virtual wall can be composed of a variety of virtual buildings.

Artificial field scanning can also make the human body virtualisation, by light composed of virtual human body on the earth will be popular on a large scale.

Artificial field scanning technology, can make many products are virtual, the future of the computer, mobile phones, and processing information related products can be completely virtualised.

Billions of people around the world can use a virtual mobile phone or called a computer, the user can quickly appear in their own side of the three-dimensional three-dimensional virtual images and sounds, do not use when, a wave of the hand can immediately disappear.

## IX. Space-time refrigerator

We store our food in a space-time refrigerator, and although the temperature inside is the same as that outside, this space-time refrigerator is illuminated by the artefactual field, and we have already passed a year outside, and only a second has passed inside, so this refrigerator preserves food at a level of freshness that ordinary refrigerators cannot hope to achieve.

On the other hand, a year has passed inside and only one second has passed outside, which is also achievable.

The basic principle of the space-time refrigerator is that the artificial field irradiates the space, which can change the speed of time passing of all events inside the space.

## X. Field scanning technology for conscious reading and storage

Human consciousness and thinking are formed by the movement of charged particles and ions moving in the human brain, which exert a perturbing effect on space.

The artificial field scanning equipment sends out the field, an invisible substance, deep into the interior of the human brain, which can scan and record the movement of these charged particles in the form of a non-destructive scan, and also record the perturbation effect of the space around the human brain.

This can read and record the complete human consciousness and memory information, thus further copying down the human consciousness information, digitising it and storing it in electronic computers.

To be a few hundred years after the development of human science and technology to a certain extent, and then these consciousness information installed in an artificial, no autonomous consciousness of the young man's body, or organisms, so that people resurrected, so that people's immortality can become a reality.

This field scanning technology can also change the mode of education, can be high-speed to the human brain delivery of rote learning and other knowledge, so that people learn time is greatly reduced.

Artificial field scanning issued by the field of this invisible material, is the human brain and computer, the Internet docking the only feasible ideal medium. And wires, electromagnetic waves, ultrasound, x-photons, electrons, lasers, and anything else that goes deep into the human brain will destroy it.
