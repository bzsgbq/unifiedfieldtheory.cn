## Abstract

According to special relativity, the relationship of electromagnetic conversion in a linear moving vacuumand the relationship formula between the magnetic vector potential/scalar potential and the LEM (Longitudinal Electromagnetic) waves,it is inferred that the spherical vacuum space we are in undergoes outward helical motion at the speed of light following the right-hand screw rule, accompanied by a radial space expansion motion far less than the speed of light.Based on this space basis, we derive a unified field equationindicating that the gravitational field might be equivalent to the acceleration field of the radial expansion motion of our vacuum space,the strong nuclear force field presumablyis generated by the light-rotation angular velocity of our space, the weak nuclearforce field is most probablyproduced by its radial expansion motion and the electromagnetic field is undoubtedlyproduced by the radial linear motion of our space at the speed of light. We have also demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that the LEM waves can generate artificial gravitational fields, and the LEM wavesare the material basis of the unified field theory.Essentially, on Earth, time is the result of the relativistic length contraction effect caused by the radial space expansion speed, which leads to the rate of change of distance in the radial dimension on the unit radial space expansion speed. Moreover, based on the length contraction effect in special relativity, the time and space generated by the outward helical motion of space at the speed of light can be expressed as zero. This indicates that such motion not only does not affect the seemingly perpetually stationary space that we can constantly perceive but also enables the gravitational field formula to remain unchanged in our space. They constitute the spatio-temporal basis of the unified field theory. Based on our unified field theory, we have also discussed some forward-looking perspectives, such as motion at the speed of light, anti-gravitation fields, and interstellar travel.
